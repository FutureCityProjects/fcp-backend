        # which causes tables that are target of a foreign key constraint to
        # be deleted before the association table(s), which in turn causes
        # "1701 Cannot truncate a table referenced in a foreign key constraint"
        # So we use our custom driver to disable foreign key checks for TRUNCATE
        # because only with TRUNCATE instead of DELETE FROM we ensure the same
        # autoincrement IDs for fixtures in tests
